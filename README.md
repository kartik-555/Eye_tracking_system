# Eye_tracking_system
This is basic version of eye traking made with simple tensorflow cnn model 
first we have trained the model with dataset with images of close, forward, left and right images of eyes with 50 epochs and 4 classes
after training the model i have feed the trained file to the opencv model which detect the eyes from the frame and apply model to detect if it is look left,right,forward or closed.
i am going to upgrade this model for more accuracy 
currently it is giving 98 percent accuracy since having good quality camera also impacts the accuracy 
this is basic version going to upgrate in future
